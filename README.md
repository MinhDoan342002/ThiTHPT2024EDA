# ThiTHPT2024EDA

This EDA project aims to analyze the performance of candidates in a high school entrance exam. The dataset includes information on candidate demographics, scores for various subjects, and foreign language choices.

##Key Findings:

Missing Data: The dataset contains missing values in several columns, particularly in foreign language subjects and natural sciences.
Foreign Language Choices: English is the most popular foreign language choice, followed by Russian and Chinese. However, the distribution of high scores varies across different languages.
Subject Performance: Candidates performed well in natural sciences subjects, with a significant number achieving the highest possible scores. Social science subjects, particularly gdcd and dia_li, also had a high proportion of top performers.
Top Scorers: The analysis identified the number of candidates who achieved the highest possible scores in each subject.
Data Quality: The dataset exhibits some data quality issues, including missing values and potential inconsistencies.

##Future Directions:

Investigate Missing Data: Further explore the reasons for missing data and consider imputation techniques or removal strategies.
Analyze Performance Factors: Investigate factors that might influence student performance, such as demographic information, school characteristics, or socioeconomic factors.
Compare to Previous Years: Analyze how the performance of candidates in this year's exam compares to previous years or other cohorts.
Consider External Factors: Explore external factors that might have affected exam performance, such as changes in the curriculum, teaching methods, or exam preparation resources.
By addressing these future directions, this EDA project can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing student performance in the high school entrance exam and inform educational policies and practices.
